When changing the hostname of your system, you must perform the following actions before you start any MythTV programs.
 If you start a MythTV program before modifying the hostname in the database, the program will create new entries 
 with the new hostname, meaning that the following procedure will fail because of duplicate entries--and will corrupt 
 the database in the process. Therefore, you will need to restore the database backup you made before attempting the 
 host name change (specifically, one you made before you ran any MythTV programs on the new host name), and then perform the name change.
